          <h1>Amaterasu</h1>
          <p>
            Amaterasu (天照) is the Japanese sun goddess, daughter of creator
            deities Izanagi and Izanami, and central to the Shinto religion. It
            is from her the Japanese nobility claims descent and their divine
            right to rule. Amaterasu is the great and glorious goddess of the
            sun. An embodiment of the rising sun and Japan itself, she is the
            queen of the kami and ruler of the universe. The Japanese Imperial
            Family claims to have descended from her, and this is what gives
            them the divine right to rule Japan. She is the center of Shinto,
            and Japanese spiritual life.

          <h1>Ame No Uzume</h1>
          <p>
            Ame-no-Uzume is the Japanese goddess of the dawn, known for her
            merriment and humor. Credited with inventing the performing arts,
            her spontaneous dancing once saved the world from eternal darkness.
            Ame-no-Uzume is the Shinto goddess of dawn, a master of
            merry-making, humor, and dancing. A highly positive kami (a type of
            god or spirit in the Shinto religion), her ingenuity brought
            Amaterasu, the sun goddess, back into the world, saving the earth
            from eternal winter’s night. A popular deity, Ame-no-Uzume is
            credited with the origination of the performing arts.

          <h1>Inari</h1>
          <p>
            Inari (稲荷) is one of the most popular Japanese deities, a kami
            with influence over rice, tea, general prosperity, smithing, and
            foxes. Being imbued with many different roles, their shrines are the
            most numerous in Japan. Inari is the Japanese kami (a type of god or
            spirit in the Shinto religion) of prosperity, tea, agriculture
            (especially rice), industry, and smithing. A complex deity with many
            faces, Inari is variously referred to as male, female, and
            androgynous, depending on the context. Although Inari’s role has
            changed over time, they have been popular throughout Japan for more
            than a thousand years. Inari is perhaps most well-known due to their
            association with foxes, called kitsune, who act as Inari’s
            messengers and receive protection in return.

          <h1>Kannon</h1>
          <p>
            AKannon (観音) is the goddess of compassion and mercy, the keeper of
            peace and reliever of troubles. The most popular bodhisattva in
            Japan, she also relieves drought, helps women to conceive, and makes
            good wishes for the world. Kannon is the bodhisattva (a revered
            Buddhist figure on the path to enlightenment) of compassion and
            mercy, worshiped in Buddhism across Eastern and Southern Asia. In
            Japanese mythology she takes on divine features and is a popular
            deity, perhaps the most widely worshiped bodhisattva in Japan.
            Sendai Daikannon, a giant statue of Kannon located in Sendai, Japan,
            is among the largest statues in the world.

          <h1>Susanoo</h1>
          <p>
            Susanoo is the tumultuous Japanese god of seas and storms, thunder
            and lightning. Too wild to remain in orderly heaven, he is
            nonetheless a heroic mythological figure, slayer of a fearsome
            eight-headed dragon. Susanoo-no-Mikoto is the Japanese god of the
            sea and storms. A powerful and boisterous guardian kami, Susanoo’s
            moods are often as temperamental as his actions are chaotic. His
            fight with the dragon Orochi led to the creation of the sword
            Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi, one part of Japan’s sacred regalia.
