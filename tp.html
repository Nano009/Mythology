				<blockquote style="text-align: justify; font-family: inherit; font-size: 20px; color: #6E6E6DFF;">Greek mythology starts at the beginning of the world! The Greek Gods that existed then were the Primordial Gods. The famous work of Hesiod, called Theogony (meaning “birth of the Gods” in Greek), presents a complete cosmogony. Natural forces are personified, and the most basic components of the cosmos are Gods.</blockquote>
				<blockquote style="text-align: justify; font-family: inherit; font-size: 20px; color: #6E6E6DFF;">The first born of the immortals, who formed the very fabric of the universe, were known in Greek mythology as the Protogenoi (protos meaning "first," and genos "born"). They were, for the most part, purely elemental beings - Uranus was the literal sky, Gaea the body of the earth, etc. A few of them were ocassionally described or portrayed in anthropomorphic form, however these forms were inevitably inseperable from their native element. For example Gaea or Thalassa might appear as a woman half risen from the earth or sea.</blockquote>

				<blockquote style="text-align: justify; font-family: inherit; font-size: 20px; color: #6E6E6DFF;">According to Hesiod, in the beginning there was Chaos. Chaos was the personification of the absolute nothingness - an immerse, dark void from which all of the existence sprang. Out of Chaos came Eros, the god of love and procreation. We can see that ancient Greeks considered love as one of the most fundamental powers in the world. Then Tartarus was born, a dark place like the abyss and the original god of the Underworld. Goddess Gaia then followed, the personification of Earth. Erebus, the god of darkness, and Nyx, the goddess of the night, were also born from Chaos. From Gaia came Ourea, the god of the mountains, Pontus, the god of the sea, and Uranus, the god of the heavens.</blockquote>
